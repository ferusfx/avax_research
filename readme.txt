Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users using the network (nÂ²).

Active adddresses significantly under-count the number of users, because many users are holding Bitcoin long-term as a speculative investment and store of value, rather than transacting in it frequently, but this number is still a good proxy and a solid leading indicator of Bitcoin's long-term value growth.

This indicator is currently predicting a higher future value for Bitcoin, but it can...
... Transaction count is a count of the number of on-chain transactions recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. There's currently a theoretical
maximum of about 6 transactions per second, or about 518,000 transactions per day. A higher number of average transactions per second represents
higher network utilization. The last time transaction counts were this high, BTC was value at almost $20k. Transaction count is a strong indicator of a healthy network activity.

When a high transaction count is coupled with low fees (like we currently have), it's also a good indicator of Bitcoin network.
